### Analysis of the Boeing 737 MAX Failures: Ethical Lessons from MAE 4300

In my MAE 4300 engineering ethics class, we delved deeply into the Boeing 737 MAX crises, examining the technical failures, ethical lapses, and broader implications for the aerospace industry. The two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, resulted in 346 deaths and exposed systemic flaws in Boeing's design, testing, and corporate culture. This writeup compiles our class discussions, drawing on key sources like the FAA's review of the 737 MAX, Henrico Dolfing's case study on the $20 billion disaster, and David F. Larcker's analysis from the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance. Through this lens, I'll analyze the failures, ethical dimensions, stakeholder impacts, and multifaceted challenges, before reflecting on personal lessons for my future engineering career.

#### Technical Analysis of the Failures, Boeing's Reaction, and Aftermath

The Boeing 737 MAX was introduced as an upgrade to the venerable 737 family, primarily to compete with Airbus's fuel-efficient A320neo. A key design change involved replacing the older CFM56 engines with larger, more efficient CFM LEAP-1B engines. These engines, due to their size, had to be mounted higher and farther forward on the wings to maintain ground clearance, altering the aircraft's aerodynamics. This repositioning caused the plane to pitch upward at high angles of attack (AoA), potentially leading to stalls. To address this without requiring a full redesign or extensive pilot retraining, Boeing introduced the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), a software "band-aid" intended to automatically push the nose down in such scenarios.

However, MCAS had critical flaws. It relied on a single AoA sensor, making it vulnerable to faulty data, such as from a bird strike or sensor failure, which could trigger erroneous activations. The system was powerful enough to override pilot inputs repeatedly, and its safety assessments were not classified as "catastrophic," leading to ignored redundancies like dual sensors. MCAS was designed for high-speed scenarios, but repeated activations in failure modes were not adequately tested or documented in flight manuals. Warnings from engineers and test pilots about potential MCAS issues were dismissed, and management downplayed its novelty and risks in presentations to regulators and airlines.

Boeing's initial reaction exacerbated the crisis. After the first crash, the company blamed pilot error and insisted MCAS would rarely activate, delaying a grounding that could have prevented the second incident. Boeing made system changes mid-certification to minimize scrutiny and aimed for minimal "Level B" pilot training to cut costs and speed market entry. The aftermath was devastating: a 20-month global grounding cost Boeing an estimated $20 billion in direct expenses, including fines, settlements, and production halts. The FAA's delegated authority to Boeing for self-certification came under fire, leading to reforms like enhanced oversight. Legally, Boeing faced a $2.5 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2021, though critics argued it lacked sufficient accountability for executives.

#### Ethical Analysis of the Design Timeline and Organizational Issues

The timeline of the 737 MAX development was riddled with ethical compromises driven by financial pressures and a flawed corporate culture. Boeing prioritized speed and cost savings over safety to counter Airbus's market gains, opting for a redesign of the existing 737 frame rather than a new aircraft. This accelerated schedule created immense pressure, with engineers reporting to business leaders rather than technical experts, fostering a culture where safety concerns were sidelined for profits. Internal flaws included inadequate testing, MCAS failure modes were overlooked, and a disregard for whistleblower protections, where employees feared career repercussions for speaking out.

Ethically, this violated core principles like balancing finances with safety and quality. Design oversights, such as engine placement leading to MCAS dependency, highlight the risks of rushed timelines applicable to all engineering firms. Accountability was misdirected toward technical fixes rather than administrative root causes, undermining workplace culture and preventive measures. The question of allowing flights after the first crash is poignant; a grounding could have averted the second disaster. For comparison, in late 2025, Airbus issued a major recall for up to 6,000 A320-family jets due to a flight-control software glitch triggered by solar flares, grounding planes briefly but prioritizing safety over disruption. This contrasts with Boeing's delay, illustrating when recalls are ethically necessary in aerospace and beyond.

Consultation for design changes was another ethical failure; errors in MCAS went unchecked through approvals, with principal engineers as the last defense often overridden by management. Disclosure to pilots was minimal, MCAS wasn't fully explained in manuals or training, breaching transparency duties. These issues tie into ASME canons: engineers must hold public safety paramount while acting as faithful agents to employers. Here, accelerated timelines created conflicts, but safety should always prevail.

#### Stakeholder Analysis

The crises affected multiple stakeholders differently. Managers at Boeing viewed the MAX as a profit driver, prioritizing market share and stock value, which led to corner-cutting. Engineers, caught in the middle, faced ethical dilemmas between loyalty and safety, with many ignored when raising alarms. Victims and their families suffered unimaginable loss, placing lives in the hands of Boeing and the FAA, only to seek justice through criminal charges rather than mere financial retribution (e.g., based on Value of Statistical Life calculations). The FAA, as regulator, was criticized for over-reliance on Boeing's self-assessments, eroding its credibility. Accelerated timelines harmed engineers (moral distress) and passengers (fatal risks), while ideal scenarios, Boeing profits, FAA approvals, no deaths, were shattered by ethical shortcuts.

#### Multifaceted Challenges and Regulatory Realities

Solutions aren't straightforward due to intense competition and game theory dynamics in the duopolistic aerospace market. Firms like Boeing face pressure to cut corners to match rivals, creating a prisoner's dilemma where safety investments risk short-term losses. This discourages outspoken engineers, as whistleblowers often face retaliation, stifling preventive voices. The FAA, resource-constrained, delegates much testing to manufacturers, relying on their integrity, a system that failed here.

Core values like trust and justice were violated. Boeing and the FAA lost public trust, as victims entrusted their lives to flawed systems. Justice remains incomplete, with financial penalties insufficient for some, while the FAA pursued individual accountability amid calls for broader reforms.

#### Tying Back to Engineers and Personal Reflection

As future engineers, we are central stakeholders, directly impacting public welfare. The MAX case shows how individual actions, or inactions, can cascade into catastrophe. Reflecting personally, I've learned the importance of vigilance in ethical gray areas. If I were a Boeing engineer during MAX development, I'd aim to be outspoken, documenting concerns and escalating to superiors or ethics hotlines. However, if management was the root problem, ignoring reports as they did, I'm uncertain what I'd do next. Whistleblowing could risk my career, yet staying silent might endanger lives. This uncertainty underscores the need for stronger protections and cultures that empower engineers.

#### Key Takeaways
- **Safety and Trust as Paramount:** The MAX failures demonstrate that losing public trust and compromising safety cost Boeing far more, in lives, reputation, and billions, than a full redesign ever would have.
- **Engineering Quality Over Expediency:** Safety must always supersede financial pressures; rushed designs lead to oversights with irreversible human consequences.
- **Individual Impact in Engineering:** It's easy to feel like a cog in a large firm, but every engineer wields real power to influence outcomes affecting consumers' lives, speaking up can drive change.
- **Commitment to Core Values:** In my career, I'll prioritize safety and trust above all, remembering the MAX as a reminder to navigate difficult situations with integrity, even when uncertain.
