## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}.

**My Background**  
I am a senior, graduating December 2025, studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University, and also a former Tesla Intern. I enjoy work that challenges me technically, while also forcing me to think outside the box and be creative, and I am especially excited about robotics and automated machines. My greatest dream is to work on a device that changes the daily life of the average person.

**My Skills**  
I have experience with a variety of design software and coding languages such as CATIA V5&V6, Siemens NX, SOLIDWORKS, Fusion 360, ANSYS, MATLAB, and Python. I am also knowledgeable and interested in non-engineering subjects such as Psychology, Economy, and Philosophy.
